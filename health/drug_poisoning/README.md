## Deaths due to drug poisoning

Deaths due to drug poisoning represents the number of unentientional deaths due to drug poisoning per 100,000 persons. The data comes from [CDC Wonder Underlying Causes of Death](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html). At the data screen, the data was grouped by County, Race, Hispanic Origin, Gender, and Year. In the 'Measures' section, right under groupings, 'Age-Adjusted' was clicked and 'Standard Error' was selected. North Carolina was selected as the state, and 2006 to the current year were selected as the years.  

Under '6. Select cause of death:', 'Drug/Alcohol Induced Causes' was selected. In the selection box that appears, 'Drug poisonings (overdose) unintentional' was selected.
